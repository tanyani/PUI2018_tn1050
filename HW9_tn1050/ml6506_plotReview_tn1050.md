# Tanya Nabila (tn1050) Reviewing Mengyun Li's (ml6506) HW8 Plot

### Clarity
Most of the manhattan side of the map were easy to read. Though when it got to areas where the density number is low, I did have a hard time telling a difference on which color belong to which interval. Overall, you did a good job of making it easy to see the emphasized point where the high subway station densities are in the Manhattan area. 

### Esthethic
Viridis Color Map is a good palette to choose from. I personally like this color palette, esthetically speaking. The colors allowed me to easily spot out where the highs and lows of subway station densities.

### Honesty
It was interesting to see the subway density in New York City! 

### Suggestions
If I had to make a suggestion, I think it would be better to make the color map plotting to the continuous kind, so the legend shows a spectrum instead if interval numbers. I think that since you made the interval to 7 (which is fine), changing it to continuous would make it easier to interpret rather than having to read the legend numbers to tell which of the 7 intervals does an area belong to. 
A reference on how to make the colormap the continuous kind is in one of our previous homeworks: https://github.com/fedhere/choroplethNYC
Also it might be better to not let the legend cover any part of the map. In your case, it would help to move it to the right a little bit.
