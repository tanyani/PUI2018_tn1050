# Tanya Nabila (tn1050) Reviewing Rohun Iyer's (ri619) HW8 Plot

### Clarity
The plot is easy to read and not at all confusing. I can clearly see where most zipcodes belong to their respective interval. Rohun did a good job making the interval to 5 bins, a good number to make the plot reading more convenient.

### Esthethic
Viridis Color Map is a good palette to choose from. I personally like this color palette, esthetically speaking. The colors allowed me to easily spot out where the highs and lows of taxi complaints per streetside cafes are.

### Honesty
I can see that the plot was meant to easily show where the highs and lows of are, which I am assuming was what Rohun planned to emphasize.

### Suggestions
If I had to make a suggestion, maybe a minor change and that is to make the legend box bigger and moved to the left side of the plot to make people read it more easily.
