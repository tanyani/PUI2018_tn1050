Due Thu 12/13th at 11:59PM for both sessions. 

**Assignment 1.** 

Find periodicity with Fourier Transforms in the time series from [HW11](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/tree/master/HW11_fb55). Comment on what you find: what are the most significant periods? Follow instructions in [notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW12_fb55/subway_timeseries_instructions_part2.ipynb)
I worked together with Urwa Muaz on this assignment, but went through the rest on my own.

**Assignment 2.**

Cluster zipcodes based on the economic development (business counts) in time for 1993-2006
Clustering often takes time, particularly hierarchical clustering. Dont start at the last minute!
Comment on patterns you see: which zipcodes have similar time evolution in the number of businesses? what are peculiar the characteristics in the economic evolution of each cluster ? upward trends, downward trends, inflection points, discontinuities?
Follow [notebook instructions](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW12_fb55/HW11_Assignment1_instructions.ipynb). 
I consulted with Angel on how to find the 4 stations, then did the rest on my own.
